# ShortBOL

A scripting language for creating Synthetic Biology Open Language (SBOL).

* Craft SBOL without coding or using a CAD tool
* Develop synthetic biology designs that you can share with tools and people


## Get Started

### Dependencies

ShortBOL requires Python 3.x. and Python package dependencies are listed in `setup.py`.

### Install

1. Download or clone repository. `git clone https://github.com/intbio-ncl/shortbol.git`

2. Navigate to your install directory

3. Install dependancies with `python setup.py install --user`


### Example usage

1. `simple_example.rdfsh` in the `/examples` folder is a design for a single promoter with its associated sequence

2. Compile the `simple_example.rdfsh` file with _ `python run.py -s sbolxml examples/simple_example.rdfsh -o <output-file>` 

3. `output-file` is the name of the desired SBOL XML-RDF file.

4.  A more extensive tutorial can be found in `tutorial.pdf` in the installation directory (currently under development)

### Extensions

Extensions provide a way to execute Python code to do additional, more complex processing of the RDF triples generated by expanding templates.

Extensions intended as built-ins should be added to the `extensions` package. 'Third party' extensions can also be added at the command line, as long as they are in the Python PATH.
