Extensions provide a way to execute Python code to do additional, more complex processing of the RDF triples generated by expanding templates.
What this means that computation can be applied to the model to allow to "things" with and on the model.
To use an extension a very specific syntax is used: @extension <extension_name>(<parameters>) (Chevrons not present).
An example of an extension that actually creates all of the derived constructs from a combinatorialDerivation Model. 
This would follow the syntax @extension CombinatorialDerivation(combinatorial_derivation)

See examples for each of the Extensions currently implemented.
