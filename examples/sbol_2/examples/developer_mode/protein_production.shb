# Example showing how to describe GFP protein production.

GFP is a DNA()
pGFP is a Protein()

GFP_i is a InstanceOf(GFP)
pGFP_i is a NoneComponent(pGFP)

GFP_part is a ParticipationPromoter(GFP_i)
pGFP_part is a Product(pGFP_i)
GFP_production is a GeneticProduction()
(
	participation = GFP_part
	participation = pGFP_part	
)

gfp_mod is a ModuleDefinition()
(
  functionalComponent = GFP_i
  functionalComponent = pGFP_i
  interaction = GFP_production
)
