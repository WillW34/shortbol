# Answer 4
# The sequences of the TetR inverter parts
pTetR_seq is a DnaSequence("tccctatcagtgatagagattgacatccctatcagtgatagagatactgagcac")


# The genetic parts of the TetR inverter
pTetR is a Promoter()
(
	sequence = pTetR_seq 
)

#Build components for each of the DNAComponents
pTetR_c is a Component(pTetR)

#Specify the range for each part
pTetR_loc is a InlineRange(1,55)

pTetR_sa is a SequenceAnnotation(pTetR_loc)
(
	component = pTetR_c
)


tetRInverter is a DnaComponent()
(
  # include the child components
  component = pTetR_c

  # absolute positions of child components
  sequenceAnnotation = pTetR_sa

)
